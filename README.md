## Communication Protocall
We have been comminicating regularly on Slack and weekend group zooms to collaborate. 

## Reason for choosing data set:
We all love wine and people are constantly asking recomendations for wine and we want to create a website where one can put in some specifications and be provided with a few options.

## Questions:
1. What is the biggest impact to the quality point rating? ex... region, variety, or taste descriptions.
2. Could our machine learning apply while scraping a couple wine based websites?
3. What's the relationship between the price point and the quality point ratings?

## Machine Learning Module
* Takes in data in from the provisional database. Temporarily using csv but will convert to database.
* Outputs label(s) for input data.

## Database Module
* Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema
* Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database
