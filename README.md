Reason for choosing data set: We all love wine and people are constantly asking recomendations for wine and we want to create a website where one can put in some specifications and be provided with a few options.

Questions:

1. Can we use natural language to convert the descriptions of the wines?
2. Can we use machine learning to do grouping?
3. Can we create an html to provide a user an easy format to find a few wine suggestions?
